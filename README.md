# Microsoft Graph Training Module - Build MVC apps with the Microsoft Graph .NET SDK

This module will introduce you to working with the Microsoft Graph .NET SDK in creating an ASP.NET MVC web application to access data in Office 365.

This module is based on the following Microsoft Learn module: [Build ASP.NET MVC web applications with the Microsoft Graph .NET SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/msgraph-build-aspnetmvc-apps)

## Lab - Build MVC apps with the Microsoft Graph .NET SDK

The lab for this module is available in multiple units within the associated Microsoft Learn module. Use the following links to jump to the specific unit. Each Microsoft Learn unit represents a different lab exercise and demo in the presentation.

1. [Exercise: Create ASP.NET MVC web app and register Azure AD app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/msgraph-build-aspnetmvc-apps/3-exercise-create-app)

   In this exercise, you'll create an ASP.NET MVC web application with Visual Studio and Azure AD application with the Azure Active Directory admin center. Once the application is created, you'll then add the necessary packages and libraries that support user authentication and requesting data from Microsoft Graph.

1. [Exercise: Incorporate the Microsoft Authentication Library into ASP.NET MVC web apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/msgraph-build-aspnetmvc-apps/5-exercise-add-auth)

   In this exercise, you'll extend the application from the previous exercise to support authentication with Azure AD. This is required to obtain the necessary OAuth access token to call the Microsoft Graph API. In this step, you'll integrate the OWIN middleware and the Microsoft Authentication Library library into the application.

1. [Exercise: Incorporate Microsoft Graph into ASP.NET MVC web apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/msgraph-build-aspnetmvc-apps/7-exercise-add-graph)

   In this exercise, you'll incorporate Microsoft Graph into the application. For this application, you'll use the Microsoft Graph Client Library for .NET to make calls to Microsoft Graph.
